Experiments:

Experiments can be executed by running the Experiments file.
The input arguments are as follows: 

1. Experiment number (exp1, exp2)
2. lin/kd for linear or KD rangequery
3. CSV filename
4. EPS
5,6,7. X Y Z of point

Note: In the assignment there were two spellings for the CSV files:
1. Point_Cloud1.csv
2. Point_Cloud_1.csv
I chose the first option and applied the change to all the CSV files
